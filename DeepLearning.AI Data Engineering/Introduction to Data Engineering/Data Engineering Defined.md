In the early days, data engineers were essentially software engineers whose primary focus was building the software applications organizations needed. Not too long ago, the data generated by these applications was often seen as a byproduct—almost like exhaust.

Imagine a software application running in the background, logging various events as it operates. This logged data might have been useful for troubleshooting or monitoring the health of the application, but it wasn’t considered inherently valuable on its own.

Over time, however, organizations began to recognize the intrinsic value of data. As the volume and variety of data generated by software applications, uploaded by users, or created through the digitization of records continued to grow, software engineers started building systems specifically designed to ingest, store, transform, and serve data for various use cases. This marked the emergence of data engineering as a distinct and central function within organizations that work with data. The role of data engineer was born. 

> [!info] Data Engineering
> The development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that **take in raw data and produce high quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases**, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.

## Data engineering life cycle

The lifecycle can be thought of as a series of stages:

![[data_engineer_lifecycle.svg]]
Data engineering lifecycle

1. **Data generation and source systems** (on the left): This is where the lifecycle begins. Source systems could include software applications, user-generated data, sensor measurements, or other data sources.
2. **Ingestion, transformation, storage, and serving** (in the middle): These are the core stages that data engineers focus on. Storage is depicted as spanning the entire width of the box because it underpins every stage above it.
3. **End use cases** (on the right): These represent how stakeholders derive value from the data, such as through analytics, machine learning, or Reverse ETL (which involves sending processed data back to source systems to provide additional value).

In practice, the data systems you build may not be as linear as the diagram suggests, but this framework is a helpful way to visualize the common elements of any data system.

## Data Pipeline

> [!info] **Data Pipeline**
> Combination of architecture, systems, and processes that move data through the stages of the data engineering life cycle. 

We often use the term **data pipeline** to collectively describe the various steps data passes through on its way from generation and source systems on through to end use cases. As a data engineer, your role is to manage this lifecycle—starting with extracting data from source systems and ending with delivering data for use cases like analytics and machine learning. In simpler terms, your job is to take raw data, transform it into something useful, and make it available for downstream use cases.

## Undercurrent

Within our definition of data engineering, it sits at the intersection of six key areas: security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. We refer to these as the **undercurrents** of the data engineering lifecycle.

Data engineering lifecycle and it’s undercurrents

These undercurrents are not stages themselves but rather span the entire lifecycle. Each of these undercurrents is relevant to all the stages of the life cycle above. 

## Conclusion

It’s easy for data engineers to get caught up in the technical details of implementation and experimentation with tools and technologies. However, it’s crucial to keep sight of the bigger picture: how your work aligns with the goals of your organization and delivers real value. We’ll explore how to think holistically about the data engineering lifecycle and its undercurrents, ensuring you can translate stakeholder needs into system requirements and deliver meaningful value for your business.
