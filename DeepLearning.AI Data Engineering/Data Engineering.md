## Background

Over the past decade, nearly every industry has undergone a digital transformation. Digital communication is now pervasive, and digital data has replaced paper as the primary medium for storing information across healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education, technology, and virtually every other sector. However, this tidal wave of data brings both opportunities and challenges. Organizations must find effective ways to store, process, and derive value from this data to improve customer experiences, outmaneuver competitors, and drive innovation. This is where robust data pipelines become critical—and why the demand for skilled data engineers is skyrocketing.

Over the years, companies have come to recognize data as an invaluable asset. Now, they’re investing in the foundational infrastructure needed to reduce the time-to-value from days, weeks, or months down to hours, minutes, or even seconds.

With the rise of AI, taking a **data-centric approach** is more important than ever. It’s encouraging to see the growing recognition of the importance of data infrastructure and methodologies—especially as AI becomes central to every company’s strategy. Whether you’re working with a small CSV file or massive datasets stored in data warehouses—or even training large language models with trillions of tokens—the ability to engineer high-quality data is essential for AI and machine learning to succeed.

The core skills required to build robust data infrastructure were largely the same, regardless of the downstream tasks—whether it was data science, machine learning, or delivering embedded analytics within applications. Over time, these core skills evolved into what we now call **data engineering**.

This program is designed to teach you the frameworks, principles, and mindset of a data engineer. We’ve partnered with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to provide hands-on, practical exercises that will help you build data systems in the cloud. Today, most data engineering happens in the cloud, and AWS is the most widely used public cloud platform. Gaining experience with AWS will be a significant asset as a data engineer.

In terms of prerequisites, all you need is prior experience working with data and Python. Familiarity with SQL and cloud tools is a plus, but not required—we’ll provide the resources you need to get up to speed.

This specialization consists of four courses:
 1. [[Introduction to Data Engineering]]
 2. [[Source Systems, Data Ingestion, and Pipelines]]
 3. Data Storage and Queries
 4. Data Modeling, Transformation, and Serving

## Scenario

Throughout these courses, imagine yourself in a specific scenario: You’ve just been hired as a data engineer at an exciting new e-commerce company. Before hiring you, the company brought on a data scientist. Their goal was to dive into analytics to better understand customer interests, behaviors, and purchasing habits. They also wanted to leverage large language models to automate parts of their customer support system.

However, when the data scientist started, they quickly realized that the necessary data infrastructure to support these analytics and machine learning projects didn’t exist yet. They had to explain to leadership that building data infrastructure wasn’t their expertise—and that to optimize for success, the company needed to hire a data engineer.
