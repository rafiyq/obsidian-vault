When it comes to orchestration, there are several core concepts and components that remain consistent across tools, regardless of the specific platform you’re using. In this video, I’ll explore these foundational ideas and explain how they can help you manage your data pipelines more effectively.

| Pros                  | Cons                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Set up dependencies   | More operational overhead than simple Cron scheduling |
| Monitor tasks         |                                                       |
| Get alerts            |                                                       |
| Create fallback plans |                                                       |

Let’s revisit the example of Cron scheduling from [[Before Orchestration]]. There’s a major limitation: if one task runs longer than expected, the next task might start prematurely, potentially breaking the entire downstream process. Orchestration solves this problem by introducing **dependencies** between tasks.. You can configure tasks to wait for their predecessors to complete before starting, ensuring a smooth and reliable workflow.

Most orchestration frameworks, including Apache Airflow, require you to define your pipelines as DAGs. These frameworks often provide user interfaces for visualizing, debugging, and monitoring your pipelines.

## Orchestration in Airflow

In Airflow, for example, you define DAGs programmatically using Python code. Here’s an example of what that might look like:

Once your DAG is defined, you can visualize and manage it through the Airflow UI. This interface allows you to trigger runs, monitor task progress, and troubleshoot issues.

You can also configure your DAG to run based on **time-based schedules** (e.g., daily at midnight) or **event-based triggers** (e.g., when a specific dataset is updated).

For instance, to make your DAG event-driven, you can define a **sensor** that waits for an external event, such as the upload of a file to an S3 bucket. Here’s an example of how you might set that up:

![[DAG_schedule_python_s3bucket.svg]]

In this case, the DAG will pause until `myfile.csv` is available in the specified S3 bucket.

Beyond dependencies and scheduling, orchestration platforms like Airflow also enable **monitoring, logging, and alerts**. You can track task performance, set up notifications for failures, and even implement **data quality checks** to ensure your data meets expectations. These checks might include validating schemas, detecting null values, or verifying value ranges.

## Conclusion 

These concepts are universal and apply to most orchestration tools. Next, I’ll guide you step-by-step through setting up orchestration for your data pipelines in Airflow.
