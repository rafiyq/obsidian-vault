## Practice Lab: Human sleep patterns and stress - Part 1

In order to monitor whether they experience stress during sleep, your friend has been recording some sleep variables using a wearable fitness and health tracker for the past 6 months. However, they have no idea how to interpret the data. That's why they've asked you, their data analyst friend, to help them out. They gave you access to their daily measurements. Your goal is to study the different features and help your friend understand if they are suffering from stress during sleep or not.

## Graded lab: Forest fire prevention

As a Data Analyst for the Portuguese parks agency, one of your key responsibilities is to assist in wildfire prevention. To support this, you will analyze the Forest Fires dataset, which details 517 fires in Montesinho Natural Park from January 2000 to December 2003. Your goal is to uncover insights into the conditions that contribute to wildfire ignition and the factors influencing the size of the affected areas. Your analysis will play a crucial role in developing strategies to prevent and manage wildfires effectively.

## Graded Lab: Forest fire prevention follow up

Building on your previous wildfire analysis, local agencies successfully detected two wildfires early. They now seek your assistance to advance this analysis further. They are particularly interested in predicting wildfires in specific park areas and modeling certain features. Your task is to refine your understanding of the population, gain deeper insights into feature distributions, and estimate relevant probabilities using your data.

## Graded Lab: Diamond prices

In this lab, you will be working for a prominent jewelry retailer that specializes in diamonds. Your task is to assist in optimizing pricing strategies to enhance profitability while maintaining a competitive edge in the market. Using statistical tools, you will model the key factors that influence diamond prices. Specifically, you will estimate the average price of diamonds with various characteristics to ensure alignment with current market trends and evaluate whether differences among diamond grades, such as clarity and cut, are statistically significant.
