## Step 1: Understanding the business problem

In the previous practice lab, you were working with a gift shop owner. Your goal was to determine if shifting to an e-commerce business model would be advantageous. 

1. Use the prompts below to explore the business problem with the LLM. You can construct your own prompts and follow-ups as well. Be creative, and remember to maintain a skeptical mindset.

|ðŸ‘¤**ðŸ’¬ Prompt 1**|
|---|
|_I am a data analyst working with a gift shop owner. How can I determine if shifting to an e-commerce model would be a good idea for this particular business?_|
|**Follow-up:** Ask the LLM to elaborate on one of its suggestions. For example, the LLM might suggest conducting a "SWOT" analysis. Ask for more information!|

|ðŸ‘¤**ðŸ’¬ Prompt 2**|
|---|
|_I have obtained a dataset of E-commerce sales from a London-based gift shop. It includes a list of each transaction, the quantity sold, the total price, date of sale, and the location of the customer. The data is from 2019. How can I use this data set to help explore this business question?_|

2. Great work prompting! Move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Asking for the global context

The gift shop owner is asking you to help figure out where they should target their marketing campaigns and sales initiatives. In order to better inform this business decision, you decide to investigate global trends in e-commerce sales.

1. Try the prompt below. Are you able to get a useful answer?

2. Try doing a web search for the same question (for example, using Google). Are you able to get a more useful answer?

3. Once youâ€™ve evaluated the LLMâ€™s response, move on to the next step.

## Step 3: Asking for help in the transition

Your gift shop client is now seriously considering the move to e-commerce. They're wondering how they would go about transitioning from a brick-and-mortar to an e-commerce model. You decide to brainstorm ideas for processes and tools using the LLM.

1. Use the prompts below to explore the business problem with the LLM. You can construct your own prompts and follow-ups as well. Be creative, and remember to maintain a skeptical mindset.

| _What are some industry standard tools that could be used for collecting and monitoring this data? Please succinctly explain the advantages and disadvantages of each._ |

2. Once youâ€™ve evaluated the LLMâ€™s response, move on to the next step!

## Step 4: Storing the data
